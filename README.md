## 🧠 How It Works

This app follows a modular architecture with a smart separation between the **frontend UI** and the **AI-powered backend logic**.

### Frontend (Next.js + React)

- Collects user input through sleek, interactive forms.
- Displays dynamic SEO reports fetched from the backend.
- Uses `Server Actions` to securely invoke AI-powered analysis flows.

### Backend (Genkit + Gemini AI)

- Defines robust data schemas using Zod.
- Crafts detailed prompts for Gemini to analyze headers and URLs.
- Processes the AI response and returns structured JSON to the frontend.
